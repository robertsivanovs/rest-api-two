### Back end:

1. Laravel 10 [Laravel Framework (https://laravel.com/)]
2. MySQL
   
### Front end:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
2. JavaScript - InertiaJs/Vue.js

### Setup instructions:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create an empty DB
3. Rename file ".env.example" to ".env"
4. Setup DB configuration in ".env" file
5. Run "composer install" from project root
6. Run "php artisan migrate" from project root
7. Run "php artisan key:generate" from project root
8. Run "npm install" from project root
9. Run "npm run dev" from project root
10. Run "php artisan serve" from project root (or use any other local server Nginx/Apache etc)

    The first app should be up and running at this point.
    config/firstapp.php contains the URL to the second app, you should adjust this.
